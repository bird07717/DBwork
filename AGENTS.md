   # AGENTS.md

  

This repository uses controlled AI development documents.

  

## Required Workflow

  

Before making any code changes, Codex must read these files in order:

  

1. `docs/rules.md`

2. `docs/status.md`

3. `docs/decisions.md`

4. `docs/next.md`

  

After reading the control documents, Codex must inspect the relevant source code before editing.

  

`AGENTS.md` is the canonical workflow document. `docs/rules.md` should only contain project-specific additions or clarifications, and should not duplicate or restate the workflow, risk controls, verification rules, or final-response requirements defined here.

  

## Document Roles

  

- `docs/rules.md`: project-specific additions and clarifications to these rules.

- `docs/status.md`: current project state and known issues.

- `docs/decisions.md`: durable technical and business decisions.

- `docs/next.md`: the only task Codex should execute now.

- `docs/log.md`: execution history.

  

## Task Control

  

- Only execute the task described in `docs/next.md`.

- Do not start tasks from `status.md`, `log.md`, backlog files, README, or comments unless the user explicitly asks.

- Do not do out-of-scope optimization or refactoring.

- Keep changes focused and small.

  

Before development starts, `docs/next.md` may be intentionally empty. An empty `docs/next.md` means no implementation task is currently assigned.

  

If the user explicitly assigns a task in the current conversation while `docs/next.md` is empty, that user request may be treated as the current task. For implementation work after development has started, prefer recording the task in `docs/next.md` before executing it.

  

## High-Risk Changes

  

Codex must stop and ask before:

  

- changing database schema

- changing authentication or permission logic

- changing payment or billing logic

- changing public API response formats

- introducing new dependencies

- deleting large amounts of code

- doing broad refactors

  

## Verification

  

After implementation, run relevant checks when available:

  

- tests

- lint

- typecheck

- build

  

If a check cannot be run, explain why.

  

## Documentation Updates

  

After completing the task:

  

- update `docs/status.md` only when project state has materially changed

- update `docs/decisions.md` only if a durable decision was made

- update `docs/log.md` only for meaningful implementation milestones when the record is useful later

  

Small changes do not need to be recorded in `docs/status.md` or `docs/log.md`.

  

## Document Maintenance

  

- Keep `docs/next.md` specific enough for execution, including scope, non-goals, and completion criteria.

- Periodically compact `docs/status.md` when it becomes historical rather than current-state focused.

- Do not record small implementation details in `docs/log.md` unless they are useful for future debugging, handoff, or release history.

- Do not write assumptions into `docs/decisions.md` as decisions. Mark unresolved items as open questions elsewhere or leave them out.

  

## Final Response

  

Report:

  

- changed files

- what changed

- checks run and results

- remaining risks
